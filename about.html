        User will be able to upload a file and receive an encrypted form of the
        same file Our encryption algorithms will include AES, Rabbit, and DES.
        These encryptions are some of the strongest encryptions there are. AES,
        Advanced Encryption Standard, is a symmetric block cipher. It is used
        throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data. DES also know as Data
        Encryption Standard. It is a symmetric-key algorithm, that encrypts
        groups of 64 bits. Each encryption has their own corresponding
        decryption algorithm.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to encryption, the web application also provides
        compression/decompression with LZ77 and DEFLATE. LZ77 is a lossless data
        compresssion algorithm. It works by groupoing symbols into strings, and
        then converting the strings into code. DEFLATE is another lossess data
        compression algorithm. This compression works by finding sequences of
        data that repeat and encode each sequence with a pair of numbers. Just
        like the encryption, with each compression, there is a also a
        decompresss for LZ77 and DEFLATE. This will allow users to safely send
        files over the internet.
